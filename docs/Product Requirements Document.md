# Rhythm – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: 1.0

---

# 1. Product Overview

Rhythm is a lightweight, offline-first Chrome extension that helps users build daily schedule discipline and maintain physical wellbeing through calm, structured reminders.

It is designed for:

- Developers
- Corporate office workers
- Remote workers
- Students
- Professionals seeking gentle structure

Rhythm runs entirely inside the browser, requires no login, and collects no user data.

---

# 2. Product Vision

To provide a calm, supportive daily rhythm assistant that lives inside the browser and helps users:

- Start work intentionally
- Take structured breaks
- Maintain posture and hydration
- End work on time
- Stay steady without complexity

Rhythm is not a productivity dashboard.  
It is not a habit tracker.  
It is not a task management system.

It is a small, steady companion.

# 3. Problem Statement

- Blur work-life boundaries
- Avoid complex productivity systems

Existing tools are often:

- Overly complex

- Cloud-dependent

There is a need for a lightweight, calm alternative.
